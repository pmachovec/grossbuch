\index{ERP}
\index{Enterprise Resource Planing}
\index{EPM}
\index{Enterprise planning management}
These abbreviations both denote a~type of~enterprise software.
Each~enterprise needs both nowadays to~be~able to~work properly.
\begin{itemize}
    \itembf{ERP} stands for~\itq{Enterprise Resource Planning}.
            It's~a~software for~managing transactions and~resources of~an~enterprise.
            Resources are all the~stuff an~enterprise needs to~work, like money (the~most important resource), available goods in~warehouses, employees etc.
            ERP~systems typically change records in~databases according to~transactions.
    \itembf{EPM} stands for~\itq{Enterprise Planning Management}.
            It's~a~software that serves for~automation of~financial processes in~an~enterprise, like budgeting, future financial planning, finance flow forecasting, creating financial reports, taxing and~many others.
            EPM~systems theoretically only read financial data from databases (they're written by an~ERP) and~perform complex computations with them.
            But~if~ERP and~EPM have separate databases, some data--write functionality is also necessary.
