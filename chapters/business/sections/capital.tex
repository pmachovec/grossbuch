\label{capital}
Each~company needs money and/or~valuable tools to~do its business.
And~this money and~tools are called \textit{capital}.
Company aims to~use the~capital to~make profit.

When the~company's business is successful, the~company earns money.
When earned money is~higher than company's costs of~operation, the~company makes profit.
Earned money can~be eventually used to~buy more and/or~better tools to~do the~business.
Either way the~capital grows.
But~when the~company does bad business (which is often the~case), earned money is~lower than costs of~operation and the~capital decreases.

In~most countries some minimal capital to~establish a~company is enforced by~law.
Also, some companies, and~even big and~successful, sometimes need more capital to~do the~business better and~make quicker and~higher profit.
And~instead of borrowing money, companies emit \hyperref[shares]{shares} to~gain capital.
