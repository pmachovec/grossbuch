\label{key}
A~key is an~information (a~\hyperref[parameterargument]{parameter}) given to a~cryptographic function when encrypting and decrypting messages.
Either the~same key is used for both encryption and~decryption (\hyperref[symmetriccryptography]{symmetric cryptography}) or~there is a~pair of~keys, one for~encryption and~one for~decryption (\hyperref[asymmetriccryptography]{asymmetric cryptography}).

In~computer cryptography the~key is a~set of~bits, usually bytes, similarly to~data itself.
And~similarly to~encrypted data it's often shown as a~printable string.
Even in~this case the~binary--to--text encoding is in~action, keys are~not fully printable by~default.
Typically the~longer your message is, the~longer key you need.
