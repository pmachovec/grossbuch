Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for~secure communication.
It~focuses on~constructing and~analyzing \hyperref[protocolstandard]{protocols} that prevent third parties or~the~public from reading private messages between a~sender and a~receiver, i.e., on~encrypting and~decrypting of~messages.
The~study of~breaking cryptographic techniques and~reading encrypted messages by~third parties (i.e., what bad~guys are~doing) is called \textit{cryptanalysis}.

In~computer cryptography the~encrypted message can~be any~data, i.e., any~set of~bits, most techniques operate with bytes.
No~matter what is~encrypted (string, file,~\dots), it's~transferred to~bits and~these are~then given~to an~encryption algorithm, which produces another set of~bits (encrypted data).
You~can often encounter a~situation when the~result of an~encryption algorithm is shown as an~ASCII string -- although just a~mess of~characters, there~is no issue with displaying any character (this is not normal for an~arbitrary set of bits/bytes).
That's because the~result was in~some (sometimes maliciously hidden) step transferred to~string by~some binary--to--text encoding, most usually \hyperref[base64]{Base64}.
