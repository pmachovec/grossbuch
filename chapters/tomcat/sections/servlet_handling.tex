\newsection{Servlet handling}
Tomcat automatically triggers \hyperref[servlet]{servlets} as~separate \hyperref[javathread]{threads}, although it~isn't \hyperref[javathreadsafety]{thread safe} by~default.
I.e.,~when two or~more users trigger the~same servlet through their browsers, it~will~work even when there's no threading implementation in~the~servlet.
However, if~users are~adjusting some common resources, e.g., the~servlet writes to~a~database, they're screwed.
Therefore, servlet--triggered logic should be always written in~a~manner expecting this.

\warning After a~servlet returns a~response, it~is \textbf{not} removed from the~\hyperref[systemmemory]{system memory}, i.e.,~its~method \textit{destroy} is~not~invoked.
The~servlet stays loaded in~the~\hyperref[systemmemory]{memory} until explicitly terminated or until the~\hyperref[garbagecollector]{garbage collector} doesn't remove it.
