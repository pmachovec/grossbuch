\label{architecturedesign}
Both these terms denote some description of~a~system before its implementation.
They differ in~the~level of~abstraction, i.e.,~in~how~concrete the~description~is.
\begin{itemize}
    \itembf{Architecture} is a~high abstraction level.
            It~describes main components of~a~system, their properties and~relations among them.
            Examples of~such components are~used programming language, individual functional parts to~implement, \hyperref[databases]{database} software or~\hyperref[server]{servers}.
          One~architecture can~be used for~multiple designs.
          Solutions for~issues commonly occurring in~software architectures are~described by~\hyperref[architecturalpatterns]{architectural patterns}.
    \itembf{Design} is a~low abstraction level.
            It~describes implementation details more in~detail, like classes, functions, their relations etc.
            Software design can~be described by~an~UML diagram.
            There can~be more designs for~one~system, each~describing different part of~the~system.
            Solutions for~issues commonly occurring in~software designs are~described by~\hyperref[designpatterns]{design patterns}.
\end{itemize}
