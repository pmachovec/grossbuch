It's~both \hyperref[charactersetencoding]{character set and~encoding} with 128 basic characters.
The~abbreviation stands for~\itq{American Standard Code for Information Interchange}.

In~old times, when computers spoke only English, programmers could live with 128, i.e,~2\textsuperscript{7} characters.
In~the~binary computer world (which lasts till nowadays), this created a~demand for~7--\hyperref[bitsbytes]{bit} memory units.
Constructors added one more bit for~some other usage and~this is the~reason why a~\hyperref[bitsbytes]{byte} consists of eight \hyperref[bitsbytes]{bits}.

With wider usage of~computers 128 characters stopped to~be enough.
Some extensions using the~8th bit appeared making the~possible number of~characters to~be~256, but~that still wasn't enough.
Therefore, multi--\hyperref[bitsbytes]{byte} character sets and~encodings appeared making ASCII obsolete.
