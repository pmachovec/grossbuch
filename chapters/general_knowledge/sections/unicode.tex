\label{unicode}
It's~a~\hyperref[charactersetencoding]{character set} containing all known characters of~all~known languages, including such~specialities like coloured pictographs from chatting applications, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Klingon language or~Tengwar (Elve script).
Unicode code points are written as~numbers in~the~hexadecimal systems prefixed \mbox{with \itq{U+}} \mbox{or with \itq{\textbackslash u}}, usually with four digits.
Higher code points for~very special characters can~have five and~theoretically even six digits.
For~example, code point for~lowercase letter \itq{a} is \mbitq{U+0061} \mbox(\itq{\textbackslash u0061}).

Unicode is based on~the~old ASCII character set.
Therefore, first 128 Unicode code points are identical to~those in~ASCII.
