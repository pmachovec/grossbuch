\begin{itemize}
    \itembf{Authentication} is a~process of~validating user's identity.
            For~example, a~user, before he~can~start using an~application, must somehow prove who~he~is.
            And~he~does this typically by providing user name and~\hyperref[keypassword]{password}.
            The~application contains an~authentication mechanism, which verifies the~user's identity (or~not).
            In~multi--factor authentication the~user must provide more proofs, for~example, a~code arriving to~his mobile as~SMS.
            Fingerprint or~eye scans, known mostly from American movies (but~existing even in~real world), are~also forms of~authentication.

\begin{itemize}
    \itembf{Authorization} is a~process of~validating user's rights to~access various resources.
            User's identity must~be~known for~authorization, therefore, it~must follow an~authentication (which provides the~identity).
            For~example, a~company's internal information system contains an~authorization mechanism, which authorizes every employee to~access the~system, but~only very few employees are~authorized to~access information about wages in~that system.
