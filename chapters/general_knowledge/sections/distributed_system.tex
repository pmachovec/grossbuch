\index{Distributed system}
\label{distributedsystem}
It's a~system whose components are~located on~different networked computers, which communicate and~coordinate their actions by~passing messages to~one~another.
All~components communicate to~achieve a~common goal.
Distributed systems have three main characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Components work simultaneously -- in~parallel.
    \item There is no global clock -- no~time synchronization among components.
    \item Components fail independently -- if~one~component fails, other components are~not~affected.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Examples are~computer networks (including the~Internet) or~telephone networks.

\newsubsection{Distributed Version Control System}

\label{distributedversioncontrolsystem}
It's~a~version control system where each user owns a~copy (mirror) of~the~whole code base including the~whole history.
The~typical example of~such system is~\hyperref[git]{Git}.
