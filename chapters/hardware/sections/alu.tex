The~abbreviation stands for~\textit{Arithmetic Logic Unit}.
It's an electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and~bitwise operations on~integer binary numbers.

\warning Do not confuse it with a~simple electronic device performing a~boolean operation over two bits (AND, OR, XOR etc.).
That's called \textit{Logic Gate}.
An~ALU consists of multiple logic gates.

\warning ALUs are parts of~CPUs, but not cores.
A~core is connected with an~ALU via an~execution port, sends inputs to it and processes returned results.
