\begin{itemize}
    \itembf{Internet} is a~huge computer network connecting smaller networks, computers, smartphones and~other devices.
            Simply it's one big computer network constructed all over the world.
            Sometimes it's referred as a~network of~networks.
            The~word \textit{Internet} therefore denotes the~connecting infrastructure, i.e.,~hardware.
    \itembf{Web}, more precisely \textit{World Wide Web}, is~one of~more software systems using the~Internet infrastructure.
            It~mainly serves for~sharing visualised and mutualy linked HTML documents accessed by web browsers, but~can also provide \hyperref[webserviceapplication]{web services}.
            Information exchange on~the~Web is~performed exclusively with the~\hyperref[http]{HTTP~protocol}.
            I.e.,~other systems like email (\hyperref[smtp]{SMTP~protocol}), remote \hyperref[shellcligui]{shell} (\hyperref[ssh]{SSH~protocol}) or instant messaging (many different \hyperref[protocolstandard]{protocols}), which also run on the~Internet infrastructure, are~not a~part of~Web.
