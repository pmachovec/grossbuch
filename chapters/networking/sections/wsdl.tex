The~abbreviation, read \mbox{as [wisd\textschwa{}l]}, stands for~\itq{Web Service Description Language}.
It's~a~formal (machine--processable) description of~\hyperref[soap]{SOAP} communication format of~a~server, which~the~server provides to~clients.
It's~actually an~\hyperref[xsd]{XSD} describing operations that~can~be performed through \hyperref[webserviceapplication]{web services}, as~well as~the~structure of~data that~can~get~passed back and~forth between systems.
Each~server communicating via \hyperref[soap]{SOAP} must have its own~WSDL\@.
