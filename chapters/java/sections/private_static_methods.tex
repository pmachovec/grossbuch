\newsection{Private Static Methods}
\label{javaprivatestaticmethods}
At~the~first glance this can~look as~a~complete nonsense.
However, a~situation can~occur when you~need to~call a~private method from a~static method (they're in~the~same class).
And~static methods can~call only static methods.
That's the~static (respective non--static) context on~which code compilation likes to~fail.
So~when you need to~call a~private method from a~static method, this~private method must~be also static.

\example[private static method]
%! language = TEXT
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
    public class SomeClass {
        public static String giveSomeString() {
            ...
            return privateStaticMethod();
        }

        private static String privateStaticMethod() {
            ...
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}
