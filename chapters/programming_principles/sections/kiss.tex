\index{KISS}
Simplicity of~a~system is~one of~main goals during the~system development.
When developing a~system, create it as~simple as~possible to~perform the~intended goal.
If~the~system is complex and~can't~be simple as~a~whole (which is typical), separate it to~a~big number of~simple components -- objects and~methods.

For~example, many (wannabe) skilled developers are~crazy about the~\textit{Rule~30}, which says that a~method shouldn't have more than 30 lines.
Also, some "experts" say to~avoid more than three arguments for~a~method or~constructor.
If~you need more, wrap them to~a~new class, instantiate it (which is a~paradox as~you need to~pass all those arguments to~that instance somehow) and~use that single instance.
